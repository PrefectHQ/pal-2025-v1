# Prefect Accelerated Learning (PAL) Labs

Welcome to the repository for the **Prefect Accelerated Learning (PAL)** program â€” a six-part video series designed to help you quickly gain confidence with Prefect through a mix of guided lessons and interactive examples.

Each module in this repository corresponds to a video in the PAL series and contains code samples that reinforce key concepts such as:

- Writing and deploying flows
- Observing and managing state
- Using caching, artifacts, and notifications
- Creating work pool-based deployments
- Designing scalable workflow patterns
- Building advanced automation and concurrency controls

> ðŸŽ“ This repository also open-sources the **Prefect Associate Certification Course** content, making it freely available for the community to explore, learn from, and build upon.

This repository contains hands-on lab materials for the Prefect Accelerated Learning (PAL) seriesâ€”a six-part video playlist designed to help you learn the fundamentals of Prefect.

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a PAL module (101-106) and includes example code that reinforces core concepts like flow creation, deployment, orchestration, infrastructure management, workflow design patterns, and advanced automation features.

ðŸŽ“ This repo also marks the open-sourcing of the Prefect Associate Certification Course content, making it freely available for the community to explore and build on.
